						<p class="card__text">My kitten is coquetry to me again. The kitten is very cute, with yellow fur and shiny coat.
						The round eyes looked piercing. </p>
						<p class="card__text">
							The kitten's paws are usually hidden in the furry foot pen, and only show their talents in a pinch. White
						Days, the kitten is always lying on the side of my bed and squinting to sleep.
						</p>
						<p>no matter what you call it, it ignores it, it is lazy; at night, it can come to sperm
							God: staring at two bulb-like eyes, shining brightly, looking everywhere, like a patrolman.</p>

						<p class="card__text">If the kitten is hungry, sometimes Rolling on the ground, wrapping my tail around my feet, 
							and screaming "meow meow...", showing a very pitiful look. Sometimes I catch mice myself,And most of the 
							times are full of rewards. 
						</p>
						<p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, 
							sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are
							 well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, 
							 growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. 
						</p>
						<p>A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. 
							It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other 
							small mammals.Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.</p>
