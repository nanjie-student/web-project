            <p>The Kinosternidae are a family of mostly small turtles that includes the mud turtles and musk turtles. 
                The family contains 25 species within four genera, but taxonomic reclassification is an ongoing 
                process, so many sources vary on the exact numbers of species and subspecies. They inhabit slow-moving 
                bodies of water, often with soft, muddy bottoms and abundant vegetation.
