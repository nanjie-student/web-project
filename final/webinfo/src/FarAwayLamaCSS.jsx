            <p>Alpacas are docile and smart. Besides, there are also a large number of domesticated species.</p>
            <p>Alpaca hair is longer than wool, bright and elastic, and can be made into high-grade wool fabrics</p>
            <p>The little girl was sprayed all over after feeding the alpaca! Forgive my unkind smile!</p>
            <p>The arrival of a family of rare alpacas from the prairie of Inner Mongolia will definitely bring a refreshing feeling to tourists; the cute and lively little fragrant pigs, little rabbits, horses, donkeys, etc. will make tourists linger and forget to return.</p>
