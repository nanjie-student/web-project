            <p>The head of the alpaca is like that of a camel, with a protruding 
                nose, two erect ears, a slender neck, and no hump. The wool fiber 
                of alpaca is long and curly, the hair length can reach 20-40 cm,
                 the fineness can reach 15-20 microns, and it is shiny, and can 
                 form a large roll, showing a wavy covering on both sides of the 
                 alpaca's body. Soft and elastic.</p>
            <p>alpaca. Alpaca? What is an alpaca? Like a sheep or a camel? Oh! 
                Very interesting. This is the first time I have heard of such an 
                animal as an alpaca! But...but what do alpacas like to eat? I tried 
                all the bread, biscuits, bananas I brought, and it didn't work. Just
                 when I was disappointed, I saw the alpaca sticking its head towards 
                 a leaf. No way...Could it be...I put the leaves in front of it, ah! 
                 Alpacas love leaves Alpacas love leaves Strange alpacas love leaves</p>
            <p>My mother urged me to go back, goodbye to the lovely alpaca, I will 
                come again</p>
